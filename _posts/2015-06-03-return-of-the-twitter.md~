Today I created this [Jekyll][jekyll] site. It's pretty awesome. I'm still learning all of the details of how it works, but I can fortunately modify and edit it via github, so I can in fact manage the site from anywhere.

I'm wondering if I can use jadelang to create these files. Markdown obviously works (this page) and Jekyll claims it can handle all sorts of things, but we'll find out I suppose.
